Applying the bankers algorithm,
It is found that the sysytem is in safe state.
A possible safe sequence is P3 >P2>P1>P0>P4


Reqd Table
A B C D 
2 2 1 1
2 1 3 1
0 2 1 3
0 1 1 2
2 2 3 3

Initially, the available resources are 3,3,2,1 after P3 they are increased to 4,6,3,3 after which the requirements of all proceses can be satisfied
