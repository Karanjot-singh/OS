Yes, A change is required in the files. Any attempt to run the same code leads to an error
P4_1.asm:13: error: instruction not supported in 64-bit mode

This is because 32bit assembly(eax, etc) and 64 bit assembly(rax, etc) use a different set of registers, Also, Arguments from A c program can be directly written to registers in 64 bit but we need to pass the arguments to stack for 32 bits.


Instructions to execute:

sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
make
./long_add
./extended_add
