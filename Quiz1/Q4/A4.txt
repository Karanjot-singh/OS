Yes, A change is required in the files. Any attempt to run the same code leads to an error
P4_1.asm:13: error: instruction not supported in 64-bit mode

This is because 32bit assembly(eax, etc) and 64 bit assembly(rax, etc) use a different set of registers, Also, In case of x64, Arguments from A C program can be directly written to registers according to the calling convention in the order rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9 for integer values.
For x86, The arguments from a function call from inside a C program are passed to the stack and accesed by the assembly

32 bit programs can run on 64 bit but 64 bit programs can not run on a system of 32 bits.


Instructions to execute:

$ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
$ make
$ ./long_add	// To run in 32 bit Assembly
$ ./extended_add //  To run 32bit program in 64 bit Assembly
