Yes , The main() can call the checkGreater() function.
the -nostdlib flag used with the gcc command passes only those files to the linker which are explicitly specified, Hence there is no clash between the main and _start methods.
This suggests that more than one entry points are possible to co-exist.

To run assembly file directly:
nasm -felf64 Q1.asm && ld Q1.o && ./a.out

To run checkGreater from c program
make
