Given the limitations of the RAM , I would prefer real mode as it  is more convenient.
In the real Mode:
There is a segment memory addressing technique. Each segment takes upto 64KB.
In Long Mode:
64 bit instructions can only be used in this mode. 16-bit instructions are disabled and no segmentation is used by x86-64 in this mode.
