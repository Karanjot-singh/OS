Given the limitations of the RAM , I would prefer real mode as it is more convenient  and the 64bit long mode is not required for a system of the given configuration .
In the real Mode:
Max capacity for RAM was 64KB but There is a segment memory addressing technique due to which upto 1MB can be utilised. Each segment takes upto 64KB.
This mode lacks:
Memory protection
Multitasking
priveleged process modes

In Long Mode:
Very high theoretical limits of RAM
64 bit instructions can only be used in this mode. 16-bit instructions are disabled and no segmentation is used by x86-64 in this mode.
